To run the program, firstly download XAMPP, which is a popular PHP development environement.
It can be found under https://www.apachefriends.org/ , download is based on the operating system you are using.

After setting up and installing XAMPP, open the XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL.
Thereafter, go your browser and type in localhost, you should be directed to http://localhost/dashboard/ which indicates XAMPP has been set up successfully.
If still unclear on how to set up the XAMPP system, do refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0lDDeVkaks

Once XAMPP is setup and functioning properly, the next step is to set up the database.

To set up the database:

Step 1: Make sure you are in localhost
Step 2: Type in localhost/CreateDB.php
Step 3: Type in localhost/CreateTable.php
Step 4: Type in localhost/addDummyRecords.php

After each successful attempt, the site will display that the database/table/records has been added in successfully. 
Once all steps are successful, your database can be said to have been set up successfully.

Last but not least, to begin the program, run localhost/default.php and you are set to go.
